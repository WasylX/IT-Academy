# 📘 Java Course Homeworks – Part 1: Fundamentals

This repository contains all the homework assignments from the **first part** of my Java programming course.  
This phase focused on mastering the **core fundamentals of Java**, preparing the ground for more advanced projects in Part 2.

Although all files are stored in a single `master` branch for simplicity, the development workflow followed a professional, Git-based process that simulated a real-world environment.

> 🏆 I achieved **nearly perfect scores** in this course through consistent coding, attention to detail, and collaboration using Git.

## 🧑‍💻 Workflow Summary

We used Git in a team-like setup:

- 🔀 Developed assignments on separate branches (not preserved here)
- 📤 Submitted homework via pull requests
- ✅ Teacher reviewed, commented, and approved code
- 🔄 Merged into `master` only after approval

This process taught essential skills:
- Working with version control in a structured manner
- Writing maintainable, reviewable code
- Following a feedback and improvement cycle

## 🧾 Repository Structure

- Files are labeled as `homework-*`
- Solutions are single files or small folders, depending on complexity
- All content is merged into `master` for simplicity
